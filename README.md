## GraphQL-Movie-Collection
The purpose of this app is to demonstrate how to set up a simple GraphQL server. 
In this project, Weâ€™ll write a small GraphQL server, create an app to browse and build
our own movie collection by requesting data from the most popular database Movie Database(TMDb).

React and Redux are used as the front-end framework of this project. However, these two libraries don't 
coordinate pretty well. A library called "react-router-redux" is used to help us keep that bit of state 
in sync with our Redux store. This library is not necessary cause using Redux and React Router directly 
and write a reducer to track the current location will work just fine, but it save a lot of hassle. For more
information regarding this library, please visit its github page.
